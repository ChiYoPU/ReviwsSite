__Setting__
> The series is set in a post-apocalyptic future, taking place in two separate dimensions; the Hole,  
 a dismal cityscape where humans reside; and the Sorcerers' world, home of sorcerers. Sorcerers are capable of traveling to and from the Hole by summoning magical doors.  
Despite appearing similar, humans and sorcerers are two distinct species, the former evolving naturally, while the latter originated from a primordial devil named Chidaruma.   
Sorcerers have specialized organs called smoke pipes in their body enabling them to produce "smoke", the source of their unique magical powers.  
Some sorcerers have weak powers (dubbed low-level sorcerers) while others may be capable of far greater feats such as resurrecting the dead or controlling time; these powers are incredibly rare and highly prized. The amount of smoke a sorcerer is capable of producing determines the effectiveness of their magic abilities. Many sorcerers work to improve their smoke output through surgery, or more commonly, the illicit use of black powder, a smoke-enhancing drug distributed by a gang of low-level sorcerers called the Cross-Eyes.  
 Smoke can also be bought and sold.  
The hierarchy of the sorcerers' world is structured around these differences in ability: powerful sorcerers, such as The En Family, enjoy a life of luxury; while weak sorcerers, who produce such low amounts of smoke they may be unable to use magic at all, live in poverty.  
 Powerful sorcerers may undergo a metamorphosis to become a devil — an immortal being with incredible powers, following a rigorous training regimen. Devils are deeply respected by sorcerer-kind and also manage the affairs of a third realm, Hell, where they work with Chidaruma to torture the souls of dead sorcerers.  
Sorcerers regularly visit the Hole to practice their magic on humans, leading to large numbers of victims and disfigured survivors.  
 Hospitals have been established to deal with the ever-growing numbers of magic victims, but humans can do little to repel sorcerers.

__Plot__
> A man named Caiman is searching for his real identity after a transformation by a sorcerer left him with a reptile's head and no memory of his former life.   
Along with his friend Nikaido, he violently assaults sorcerers in the Hole, with the aim of taking their heads into his mouth, where a strange face will appear and confirm whether the sorcerer he has bitten onto was the one responsible for his transformation or not. Somehow,  
 Caiman is immune to magical effects and as a result is extremely dangerous to sorcerers.  
The news of a lizard-headed sorcerer-killer immune to magic attracts the attention of En, a powerful sorcerer and head of a syndicate known as “The En Family”, who sends his cleaners Shin and Noi to kill Caiman. En himself is currently attempting to scrub out a gang of low-level sorcerers known as the Cross-Eyes, after an encounter with their legendary boss almost cost him his life years ago.  
As the residents of the Hole, the En family and the Cross-Eyes gang, along with many others, collide with one another, the mystery of Caiman's identity begins to unravel, reigniting ancient grudges and threatening to forever change both the Hole and the sorcerers' world.

## ドロヘドロの凄さ　The great thing about Dorohedoro!
・とにかく何でもあり！  
・倫理観ゼロ  
・餃子を食べたくなる🥟

・Anything goes！  
・No ethics.  
・akes me want to eat dumplings 🥟

## お気に入りのシーン　Favorite scene.
ドロヘドロはもう最初から最後まで奇想天外な感じだけど、特に特にこの3つがお気に入り  
__・魔法で人形を作るシーン__  
人形の作り方が完全にお料理シーンで面白い🍗  
無駄にフォンドボーとか出てくる  
料理のバリエーションも色々あって、凝った料理ほど精度が高くなるのも好き

__・みんなで野球をするシーン⚾️__  
町内会の野球みたいなノリだけど、もうツッコミどころしか無い  
何故か魔法使いの処刑場が会場だし、グラウンドには底無し沼があるし、  
魔法使いの死体を魔改造したフランケンシュタイン🧟が出場してたりもうとにかくめちゃくちゃ  
そこに特に誰もツッコまずにゲームが進んでいく狂気  
ドロヘドロのヤバさが全部詰まった回だと思う

__・魔のおまけ__  
おまけだけどめっちゃ面白いし、日常的な感じで楽しめて好き  
キャラ同士のくだらないやり取りとりと私生活を知れる  


Dorohedoro is bizarre from start to finish.  
I especially like these three.

__・The scene where the doll is made by magic.__  
How to make a doll is like a cooking show🍗  
The appearance of the fondbots  
There are many variations of dishes, and the perfection of the dishes affects the doll.

__・The scene where everyone is playing baseball⚾️.__  
It's a baseball game with the atmosphere of a neighborhood   association, but the content is hard.  
The game takes place at a wizard's execution site.  
In addition, there is a bottomless swamp on the field.  
A wizard's corpse is transformed into Frankenstein, and he plays for the team.  
Very chaotic!  
The game progresses with no one really paying attention to it.  
I think this is a scene that has all the characteristics of sludge.

__・Extra of the demon__  
I like it because it's a bonus but it's really interesting and I can enjoy it in a daily life kind of way.  
It's a great way to learn about the characters and their personal lives.

The only conscience of this work.  
He's just a normal guy.  
That normalcy is very good.  
He understands the enemy's situation and cares about his friends.  
He's a little timid, but he's a good guy who shows guts for his family.
